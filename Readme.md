# Visualization Course
This repo contains the material for the Visualization workshop for [Data Science Retreat](http://datascienceretreat.com/).

## Summary:
While we live in the era of Data, we humans are still visual animals. Being able to build a proper visualisation is your key to extracting insights from data as well as communicating it to decision makers. From data exploration all the way to analysis reporting, your data visualisation skills are indispensable for succeeding as a data scientist. This course will focus on using the web browser as the perfect platform both for sharing your visualisation and making them interactive. The first part is dedicated to D3.js, the famous javascript library for data driven visualisations, and in the second part you will learn how to build high level interactive charts for your web documents using the Python bindings of Plotly and Bokeh. The course is self-contained although previous knowledge of scripting languages like Javascript and Python are helpful.

## At the end of the course you should know...

- how to create a simple web page,
- how to convert a collection of data points into rendered objects using modern web standards,
- how to build responsive interactive charts using Python.
